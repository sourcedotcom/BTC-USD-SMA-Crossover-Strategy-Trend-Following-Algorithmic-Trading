# BTC/USD SMA Crossover Strategy â€“ Algorithmic Trading with Python

# ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements and backtests a **Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover Strategy** for BTC/USD to capture trend-following opportunities in cryptocurrency markets.  
The strategy uses:
- **10-day SMA (fast)**  
- **50-day SMA (slow)**  

When the fast SMA crosses above the slow SMA â†’ **Long Entry**  
When the fast SMA crosses below the slow SMA â†’ **Close Position**  

The system avoids lookahead bias, ensures reproducibility, and generates key trading metrics and performance visualizations.
